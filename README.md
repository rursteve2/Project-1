To run, open index.html in a web browser.

To play, click the dot

You will have 60 seconds to try to click the dot as many times as possible! As you click the dot, it will dissappear quicker and quicker the higher your score goes. It will disappear immediately when clicked or time runs out and reappear at a random spot, testing your speed. The first dot will be available for you to click, but if you miss or fail to click any of the following dots, your accuracy will decrease.
